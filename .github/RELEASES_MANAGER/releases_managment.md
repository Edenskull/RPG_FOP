# Releases Managment

## How to publish releases

To `clear` and `organize` this project we will use `semantic versioning`.  
This will be formatted as `vX.Y.Z` : 
* X for major version
* Y for medium version
* Z for minor version

### #Minor Version
This will be every change for `enhancement` like graphical enhancement, text added, deleted or modified. This will also concern the `clear code modifications` like adding function or creating libs with existing functions.

### #Medium Version
This will related to all `core code modification` and `bug fix`.

### #Major Version
This will increment for every `features creation` like adding supported language, framework, etc...
